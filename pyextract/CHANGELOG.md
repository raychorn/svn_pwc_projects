* Added DSN option to MySQL Connection Dialog

## 2.1.2 [Released]
* ABAP Bug fix removing trailing comma when length of tuple is 1.
* Oracle - Use ALU32UTF8 encoding.
* Generate hash of .data files in chunks.
* ABAP Bug fix for missing columns when using free selection '@'
* Bug fix for Connection Failed list index out of range.

## 2.1.1 [Released]
* Fixed broken previous button when continuing ABAP extraction
* Remove upper limit on SAP row size
* Updated ECF to ABAP parameter file conversion to use RFC structure instead of separate ABAP
* Re-establish SAP connection in controlled pause/resume.
* Removed reference to 'STRIPEKEY' in ABAP Output consumption
* Fixed image.IsOK() assertion error
* Fixed failure acquiring table_name because ecf was not provided in DataDefinition() for ABAP
* Added new row size config for non-SAP (50K default).
* Created FileHandler for logging vs. MemoryHandler.
* Merged docker components into main branch.
* Removed write worker timeout.
* Upgraded to cx_Oracle 6.0.2.
* Cast all cx_Oracle.NUMBER data types to decimal.Decimal to avoid loss in precision.
* Re-worked SAP connection dialogs to allow for Load Balanced Connection w/SNC.
* Add PX Version in Metadata.txt
* Add active configurations to log.
* Updated authorization checks to account for BBP_RFC_READ_TABLE.  PX will now check for both Data Services and BBP_RFC_READ_TABLE and would not stop a user from running an extraction if the client does not have Data Services, as long as they have BBP access.
* During resume, re-attempt tables that previously had errors (these were being skipped).
* Added log entry at the end to note "Package Name" and "Package Path" - just so its clear.

* For SAP, honor the batch_size configured in PwC Extract - it was default to 1000
* Goodyear apsw.BusyError fix.
* Extractions stopping when encountering auth issue.  Extraction should log error and continue.
* Fixed permission error when trying to delete files while they are still being written/added to the package (.zip).  This gets triggered when files get larger.

* Changed default chunk size to 500K
* Changed default batch size to 200
* Removed requirement that ABAP `.fil` filenames had to include a unique ID from the name of the folder containing them (because that folder might have been renamed).


## [2.0.7] - 2017-08-23 - Official Release!

### Added
* Added a `README.txt` file to the build which includes the licenses for the Python dependencies that are included.

### Changed
* Added a patched `ibm_db.py` file to the build that allows us to dynamically import DB2 dependencies.
* Removed expectation of time in Expiry Date and if there are any errors with Expiry date, just ignore the expiry date entirely.

### Fixed
* Bug 24403: Added a 200-character limit to names of saved connections.
* Bug 24409: Disabled the `Save Password` field on SAP ABAP Connection page.
* Bug 25689: Fixed typo in tooltip for Oracle `Value` user input.
* Bug 25984: If the 'Working Directory' value is set to blank (empty string) and saved, it will set the `working_directory` back to the default value.

## [2.0.6] - 2017-08-10 - Bug fixes

### Added
* Added Display Size and Scale to TableMetaData table for Oracle to fix precision issues with loader.
* Added `gui.ManageSavedConnDialog` and `gui.SavedConnGrid` classes so users can delete and update saved database credentials from their `ConfigDatabase`.

### Changed
* Updated the 'Phase 2' of ABAP extractions to not require a specific folder name to run an extraction from ABAP CSV files.
* Replaced the `gui.apply_default_window_style` function with a `gui.DefaultDialog` class, which most GUI dialogs now inherit from.

### Removed
* Removed `core.sqlite_repeater` since the root cause of the `apsw.BusyError` in `core.update_total_record_counts` was fixed.


## [2.0.5] - Unreleased

### Added
* Added a `max_readers` user configuration for adjusting the amount of multiprocessing / threading that occurs during extraction.
* Added `core.sqlite_repeater` to avoid random `apsw.BusyError` that were happening during `core.update_total_record_counts`.

### Changed
* Renamed the final executable name from `python-extract` to `PwC Extract`.
* Changed the generic name `max_workers` to `max_writers` in `core.py` to avoid confusion with the new `max_readers` user config.
* Moved `ECF` files used for testing to a top-level `/ecfs/` folder. Removed all `ECF` files from the `/tests/assets/` folder.
* Hardcoded the value for `max_writers` to always be `1` throughout the application, to avoid errors encountered during multiprocess writes to SQLite.
* Removed the 'Content Preview' functionality and replaced it with a message box displaying basic SQL query / SAP parameters for the user to copy.
* Changed the SQLite database PRAGMAs to increase performance.

### Removed
* Removed support for 1.6 versions of `ECF` files. The Extract program will now only support `ECF` files of version 2.0. All 1.6 ECFs must be converted to 2.0 ECFs using the Extract ECF Text Editor tool.
* Removed `DEBUG:` logging calls for SAP function modules.
* Removed `GPG` and `gnupg` from the program entirely.


## [2.0.4] - 2017-08-07 - DB2 Removal, Auto-upload, Password Saving

### Added
* Added detailed mouse-over tooltips to the labels of all user inputs.
* Added "Auto Upload" to configuration panel. When set to "Yes", the upload will take place immediately after successfull extraction. Defaults to "No".
* Add error handling to `sapstream.get_parent_split_info` for malformed ECFs.
* Added `utils.NetworkDisconnectError` so disconnect code is more robust.
* Allow users to save their database connection passwords in the per-user encrypted config database.

### Changed
* For all new installations, the default working directory (`Desktop/PyExtractWD`) has been moved and renamed to `%LOCALAPPDATA%/PwC/Extract/Data`.
* IBM DB2 dependencies have been removed from the default build now that a way has been found to import them at runtime. Users will now need to specify a location on their local machine for the `IBM DB2 Driver` in order to run DB2 extractions.
* Changed ERP dependency validation to be based on expected names of content within a folder instead of by the name of the folder. This makes the application more secure and allows us to provide more useful error messages when dependency folders are not set up as expected.
* Updated the 'Extract' title on the home page to also be Italic.
* Updated upload success message to "Successfully uploaded data to PwC using <method>"
* Updated "Duplicate columns within ECF" message to include the table name.
* Update `sapstream.format_params` to allow `=` parameters and disallow `!=`.
* The 'Next' button on Connection screens will now be disabled unless all required inputs are filled in by the user.
* Changed timestamps in the GUI screen to include dates.
* Changed delimiter between log elements from 4 spaces (` `) to a tab (`\t`)
* Changed log message truncation of SAP where clause items to not truncate in the middle of a value, and to also include the number of items not shown.
* Changed naming of log levels when using the GUI, renaming `WARNING` to `WARN` and `CRITICAL` to `ERROR`.
* Renamed all instances of `MFT` to `SFTP` throughout the app to avoid ambiguity. The `SFTP` service itself remains unchanged, and the key `MFT_LFU` will still be the canonical value to include in ECF files.
* Allow 'Max seconds per request' (`worker_timeout`) to be blank or `0` to signify that workers should never timeout. Updated the default option to be `0` for this setting.

### Fixed
* Fixed a bug where the `lfu_location` and `sftp_location` panels in the Production build were not being hidden.
* Disable "Next" button on the ECF Selection screen if an ECF is invalid.
* Ensured that network disconnects during SAP reads are handled appropriately. This prevents records being skipped when an extraction continues after a disconnect.
* Made sure that ABAP extractions create a `TableExtractions` file.
* Fixed a minor bug that occured when switching to and from a Connection Dialog screen that does not have a password field, after having been on a screen with a password field.
* Ensured that ABAP connection screen 'Finish' button will enable when all required ABAP files (`abap_folder` and `abap_filename`) are provided.
* Fixed typo in Oracle connection error handling in `DataStream.start()`.

### Removed
* Removed the 'Setting Default User Configs' dialog that would display on initial program launch.
* Removed the `clidriver` and `ibm_db_dlls` folders from the program.
* Removed the behavior where passwords would be cleared when navigating between connection pages. Passwords will now remain with all other previous form data, and will continue to appear obscured (`*******`)


## [2.0.3] - 2017-07-31 - Bugfixes

### Added
* Added a timeout to SAP table validation requests, so that each table takes no longer than ten seconds to validate. Please note that table validation will be disabled while we determine the impact on the SAP server from timed out requests.
* Added a `SAP Batch Size` parameter to the Configs panel, which allows the user to control how many records should be requested per RFC call during SAP extractions.

### Changed
* Changed the label of the 'Open ECF' home page button to 'New Extraction'.
* Output tables will still be created, but empty, when no records are returned for any valid (non-errored) extraction.

### Fixed
* Fixed bug where uncreated Extract config databases were identified as unencrypted, failing to create the file.
* Fixed bug in `sap.where_clause_rfc_format` that caused certain values to be skipped when using large `IN ()` statements.
* Fixed `SAPMessenger.get_metadata_from_query` to work with ECF table sections that do not have a `Parameters` section.

### Removed
* Removed unused `certifi`, `cryptography`, and `lib2to3` folders from the build.


## [2.0.2] - 2017-07-24 - Bugfixes

### Added
* Added 'Advanced Options' section (with scrollbar) to Configs screen to help maintain the growing amount of user configs available.
* Added 'Log Level' option to Configs screen, which can be set to `INFO` (default) or `DEBUG` on a per-extraction basis.
* Added ability to right-click on any cell in the Content Preview screen to copy the text to your machine's clipboard.
* Added additional library validation and error handling to `gui.validate_sap_sdk`.
* Added `error_queue` so that errors during threaded reads in `SAPStream.threaded_extract` are appropriately raised to main process and GUI.
* Add check for SAP date formats in ECF, asserting that the format is either `YYYYMMDD` or `YYYY-MM-DD`.

### Changed
* Increased default `worker_timeout` from two minutes to 20 minutes.
* Now including SAP RFC 'where filters' to each record in the extraction log that reports how many records were extracted. If the filter is a large `WHERE IN ()` list, it will be truncated in the middle, and the full list of values can be found by turning on `DEBUG` level logging.
* Improved format of 'Date Started' information on the `ContinueExtraction` screen.
* Hiding the `ibm_dll_folder` panel until we actually remove those dependencies and require the user to set that up for themselves.

### Fixed
* Bug 5579: Removed 'Fatal Error' popup that occured at the end of extractions.
* Bug 15987: Restore the text log when resuming or continuing an extraction, so that the text log for multi-part extractions still contain all logging data.
* Bug 19846: Added vertical scroll bar to Configs screen to show all fields.
* Bug 20252: Errors for fields in Configs screen will now report their user-facing names in the error instead of their Pythonic names.
* Limit data pulled to validate tables in `SAPMessenger.validate_user_access` and do not error a table if a SAP database memory limit is reached.


## [2.0.1] - 2017-07-17 - Bugfixes and SFTP Port Options

### Added
* If uploading via MFT fails when an upload type of `MFT_LFU` is selected, an upload to the LFU location will be used instead.
* Moved production `config.py` settings into `defaultconfig.py`. Updated `prd_config.py` and `qa_config.py` to import default config values from that file, and only specify the values they need to change in the environment-specific files.
* Added additional `LOGGER.debug` calls in `sapstream.py` and `sap.py`.
* Added dropdown option on Configs dialog for MFT SFTP Port ('22' or '52222').

### Changed
* Refactored unit tests to reduce duplicates (removing `tests_bvt` folder).
* Sorted the values in `.gitignore` by name and granularity.
* Replaced the `dependency.config` file with two environment variables, and wrote instructures for using a `.env` file to store this information.
* Changed minimum value for `chunk_size` (rows extracted per request) to 1000.
* Replaced duplicate code in `gui.ConfigsDialog` with `StaticLabel`, `FolderSelectPanel`, and `UserInputPanel` classes.

### Fixed
* Bug 13158: LFU uploads will now properly raise an error when a network disconnect happens during the upload process.
* Bug 17814: Update `sapstream.py` error checks to raise `AssertionError` for ECF issues, so that the GUI will no longer treat them as unhandled errors.
* Bug 18291: User config values with ranges (e.g. `chunk_size`) will now always alert the allowable range on an input error.
* Removed `sap.validate_user_access` to prevent out-of-memory errors with huge client systems.


## [2.0.0] - 2017-07-01 - Release!

*Official release version of the Extract 2.0 program.*

### Changed
* Updated SQLite database encryption to always use AES-256.
* Updated EPF response file encryption to use the `PublicKey` value provided in the ECF file. ECF files without a valid `PublicKey` from the ECF Generation Service keystore can no longer be used with the Extract program.
* Updated data package upload process to always upload to a production server, using the `Territory` value in the ECF. Note that only the `West` and `Central` territories are supported.

### Fixed
* Added validation and error handling to ensure ECFs contain `Queries` and `ChannelLos` values before processing them.
* Set a consistent label size on the Configs screen to show the full label for 'SFTP Upload Location'
* Always check for and delete outdated content at the start on an extraction. This occurs when the user manually unzips data from a package and leaves it in the working directory.


## [0.8.5] - 2017-06-28 - Release Candidate

*This version will be the last major release before production (except for critical bugfixes)*

### Changed
* Changed `ExtractData.channel` to read the `ChannelLos` value from ALL ECFs,  instead of reading the `LineOfService` value in 2.0 ECFs.


## [0.8.4] - 2017-06-27 - Bugfixes

### Added
* Added option in build configuration `USE_PWC_ECF_PUBLIC_KEY`, which will allow the program to use either the `PublicKey` value from the ECF, or a hardcoded PwC public key, when encrypting EPF response files.
* In a build that requires providing a `PublicKey` in the ECF, ECF files that do not have this attribute are no longer considered valid, and will redirect the user to the ECF Generation site if selected.

### Fixed
* SAP ECFs that contain table-level `Parameters` without a `Meta` fields will be provided default values for batch and chunk sizes.


## [0.8.3] - 2017-06-16 - Minor bugfixes

### Added

### Changed
* Updated 'Low Disk Space' message to be warning-level instead of error.

* Made `sqlite.connect_to_sqlite` create all intermediate folders to the database if they don't exist, not just the base folder of the database (in case use deletes entire working directory mid-extraction).

### Fixed
* Bug 8280: Updated `ecfreader.DataDefinition` to validate that no duplicate columns exist in an ECF query or parameter section.
* Bug 12128: Updated `SQLiteMessenger.delete_duplicates` to not throw an error if the table provided does not exist.

* Made 'Load Saved Connection' dropdown on DB2 Connection window default to no selection, instead of defaulting to the first item available.
* Made sure extractions end safely and silently if user closes application using the 'X' button mid-extraction.
* Made `SAPStream` log number of rows read with the integer comma format.

### Removed
* Removed code relating to the old 'Upload Package' button on front page.


## [0.8.2] - 2017-06-09 - Hotfix

### Fixed
* Fixed a bug that would prevent the application from opening if the user had no saved extractions.


## [0.8.1] - 2017-06-07 - ECF-based Uploads and MSI Installer

### Added
* Force production build to upload based on 'Territory' value in the ECF. Note that only the `West` and `Central` territories will be supported in production. The QA build will continue to upload to whatever location is selected on the Configs page.

### Changed
* Updated `README` and `INSTALL` documents to reflect current program state.
* Now doing post-connection query validation in its own thread, so that the GUI does not become unresponsive when validating large ECFs.
* Now saving connection details before validating queries, instead of after.

## [0.6.0] - 2017-04-17 - ABAP Workflow, General Bugfixes, Refactoring

### Added
* Function module check for SAP upon start of the GUI.
* Finished two-part ABAP workflow in the GUI.

### Changed
* Make SAP key reports stream in chunks rather than all at once to avoid overflowing the buffer.
* Removed the `core.extract` function and broke it into multiple helper functions in `gui2`. Since this function was only being called from `gui2`, and has gained a lot of `wx` and GUI-specific code, it makes more sense to break it out.
* Pass `**extract_kwargs` into `gui2.ExtractThread` instead of `core.extract`.
* Make `gui2.PyExtract.next_workflow_dialog` only return dialog name instead of returning the dialog object and its name.
* Moved all `*.ico` and `*.png` files to a new `/assets/` directory.

### Fixed
* Bug 8818: Updated SAP auth check to throw error if FM is not available.
* Bug 9072: Reject SAP tables with invalid data types.
* Bug 9132: ECFs with a past `ExpiryDate` will now raise an error on selection.
* Bug 9148: Fixed instructions on the 'File Detail' screen.

* Bug 9228: Error now raised when user attempts to access data they don't have access to in the Content Preview screen.
* Bug 9232: Raise error for SAP queries w/ an asterisk in the 'Fields'.
* Bug 9249 & 9707: Content preview now alerts user if query fails instead of hanging.
* Bug 9262: Change title on 'Oracle Connection' screen.
* Bug 9274: Updated 'Log' label on Extract screen to 'Extraction Log'.
* Bug 9275: Updated 'Progress' label on Extract screen to 'Status'.
* Bug 9368: Remove 'Windows Authentication' option from `OracleConnDialog`.
* Bug 9377: Updated column headers in Content Preview screen.
* Bug 9382: Provide more detailed error message for failed ECF parsing.
* Bug 9518: Content preview alerts user when query returns 0 records.
* Bug 9793: Deleting extractions now occurs at an Extract ID level instead of Request ID level.

### Removed
* Removed `utils.sql_escape_string` because we now properly escape columns in SQLite using double quotes, so special characters are not a problem.
* Removed `callback_success` from `core.extract` since that functionality has been replaced with `wx.Event` handlers surrounding the thread.
* Removed original `gui.py`, replaced by previously-named `gui2.py`.
* Removed `webapp` package, `config.py`, and `run_flask.py`, moving them to [their own repo in TFS](http://matlkatp2app025:8080/tfs/ECAP/PyTech/_git/pyextract-flask)
* Removed all `TODO` comments, and turned them into work items in VSTS.


## [0.5.1] - 2017-04-10 - Stop/Resume, GUI Content, General Bugfixes

### Added
* Created `gui2.GuidePanel` class for consistent look and feel of right-hand 'Instructions' pane within the GUI.
* Now setting defaults for the user 'Config' on first program launch.
* During ECF selection, if data for the ECF was previous extracted and can be resumed from, an alert will be shown to the user that prompts them to continue the extraction instead of restarting it.
* Now saving every extraction attempt to the local database so they can be restarted in case the program crashes or is closed.
* Added 'Continue Extraction' workflow from the home page.

### Changed
* Now using `TableExtractions.dat` SQLite database for pause/resume functionality in `gui2.py` (so an extraneous `pyextract.dat` file does not throw off the loader).
* Replaced custom class `gui2.BasicModal` with default `wx.MessageBox`.
* Replaced custom class `gui2.BusyModal` with default `wx.BusyInfo`.
* Rename class `gui2.Config` to `gui2.ConfigDatabase` to help distinguish it from the generic 'config' dictionaries of key-value pairs.
* Merge four functions `ConfigDatabase.does_*_conn_exist` into single function with argument `ConfigDatabase.conn_exists(erp)`.

* Bug 8178: Continue extraction for invalid queries (non SAP)
* Bug 8428: Modified row skip for large tables so workers don't shut down.
* Bug 8429: SAP connection now succeeds with this ECF.
* Bug 8495: Updated copy on 'zero records returned' error message.
* Bug 8558 & 8599 & 8612: Updated DB2 datatype mappings.
* Bug 8901: Modified check to raise an error for invalid tables and continue.

* Bug 9112: Title on landing page changed to just 'Extract'.
* Bug 9128: User will be prompted to confirm when attempting to close app.
* Bug 9131: ECF file selection dialog now only shows `*.ecf` files.
* Bug 9172: Update error message copy if an invalid `*.ecf` file is selected.
* Bug 9181: Correct instructions now shown on 'Content Preview' screen.
* Bug 9301: User is now able to resume extractions after closing the program.
* Bug 9307: Correctly able to pause and resume, hanging DB connection was cause.
* Bug 9387: User can now deselect queries in content preview.

### Removed
* Removed extraneous default positional arguments from many object calls in `gui2.py` (i.e. turning `wx.Panel(self, wx.ID_ANY, wx.DefaultPosition, wx.DefaultSize, wx.TAB_TRAVERSAL)` into `wx.Panel(self)`)
* Removed all `PASSWORD` fields from the `ConfigDatabase` tables.
* Removed extra `Panel`s and `Sizer`s in `gui2.py` used for borders and alignment, replacing them with explicit border increases or alignment changes to the core content that they were surrounding.
* Removed calls in `gui2.py` to `wx.StaticText.Wrap(-1)`, since this is the default behavior.


## [0.5.0] - 2017-03-31 - New GUI, Pause/Resume, GATT Alignment

### Added
* Add `ABAPMessenger` as an input option for data extraction from a folder of ABAP `.fil` files (module `pyextract.connect.abap`).
* Add supporting unit test for an ABAP to SQLite extraction in the `tests.test_core.TestFromABAP` class (with ECF and `.fil` file `assets`).
* Allow `Extraction.extract_id` to be set explicitly during object creation by passing a value for `extract_id` to the `Extraction.__init__` method.
* Added database tracking of extraction status at both the query level and more granular where clause level for nested extractions
* Unexpected errors that occur during the extraction process will now be logged in the `.log` file with their complete traceback.
* Expected / accounted for errors that occur during extraction will not impede extraction of other tables, and will be logged in the `TableExtractions.dat` database.
* Add validation to `SAPMessenger.get_data_from_sap` so a more specific error is raised when a column listed in an ECF does not exist in the associated table in SAP.
* Pause resume base functionality and validation
* SAP SNC connection functionality to the new GUI
* Add progress bar to GUI to track progress from query to query in an ECF.
* Added abiiity to extract SAP Key Reports (only MB5B)

### Changed
* Switch naming conventions to follow GATT Extract v1.6 strictly. All databases will now end in `.dat` instead of `.db`.
* Replaced the standalone GUI with a new shiny GUI that closely resembles the .NET version of the Extract program.
* Massive unit test refactor, removing 300 total lines of code, and bringing pylint to 9.92, while maintaining 100% of old functionality.
* Move unit test Messenger creation into `setUpClass` methods, so a failing connection to one database (e.g. Oracle) does not prevent tests for other databases (e.g. MSSQL) from being run.
* Update `ecfreader.get_ecf_meta_data` and `utils.DataDefinition` to support `SAP > ABAP` ECFs and table-based metadata.
* Update `pyextract.streams.DataStream` so that it will `trim_data` if provided a `row_limit` smaller than the number of rows returned.
* Using a `@contextmanager` with APSW connections in the GUI so that all connections are closed safely every database update.
* Update `SAPMessenger` log messages to track seconds for each pull, not aggregate seconds.
* Now encrypting output EPF files using Chilkat and a standard PwC public key (NOT the public key from the ECF files).
* Now uploading all data to the QA1 servers instead of QA2.
* Make `core.save_extract_data` function less reliant on the `ecfreader.ExtractData` attribute names.
* Allow encryption to be `None`, `AES-128`, or `AES-256` in the GUI while we are still in testing mode.

### Fixed
* Changed SAP testing host from `pwcusadsap006-00004992.cloudapp.net` to the Halo-specific `pwcusadsap006-00005525.cloudapp.net`, which is more reliable because it has less traffic.
* Fixed error in new GUI that was causing ECF filepaths to not show up properly after they had been selected.
* Make `key_size` selection in the GUI have effect on AES encryption used.
* Fix where `PyExtract.init_dialogs` is called in the `while True` loop so that 'Cancel' buttons throughout the GUI work properly again.
* Fix `core._get_table_status` call so that it will properly return `not_started` where no row exists for a database table.

### Removed
* Removed unused `Extraction.save_configuration` function until we build it properly in Sprint 7.
* Removed method `Extraction.extract_from_ecf` and turned it into a top-level function in `core.py` called `extract_from_ecf`.


## [0.4.0] - 2017-03-17 - Encryption, SQLite Chunking, and Publishing

### Added
* Add AES-256 encryption as an option to SQLite inputs/outputs, in addition to the current unencrypted and AES-128 options.
* Allow SQLite outputs to write data as: one database for all data, one database per table, or one database per chunk of data.
* Update the 'Complete' panel in the GUI to show filepath of results.
* Log the time to complete all extractions and the total records extracted from all tables after an extraction from the GUI.
* Log a warning at the end of `pyextract.extract` if zero records were extracted for every call to `Extraction.extract`.
* Add button to upload data package to a remote SFTP site after extraction.
* Add button to upload data package to the PwC LFU service after extraction.
* Warnings that occur during an Extraction from the GUI will now appear as pop-up alert boxes once the Extraction completes (Bug #5571).

### Changed
* Now using more descriptive / specific labels for user inputs in GUI.
* Split `SQLiteWriteWorker` into two classes: one for writing to a single SQLite database (default), and a new `SQLiteChunkWorker` for writing to a different database every chunk.
* Moved `setup_multiproc_logger` from `utils.py` to `core.py` (the only module that function was used in).
* Modified metadata and logging tables to write to their own database if sqlite output is used, per loader requirements
* If an Extraction is cancelled before any log messages are written, the program will still include an empty log file in the final Package, and display a warning to the user.

### Fixed
* Bug 6853: Connection to MSSQL will error if the `database` or `server` value provided is a blank string ('').
* No longer showing multiple 'Extraction Canceled' messages if the Cancel button is hit repeatedly during an Extraction.

### Removed
* Removed unused `SQLiteMessenger.sftppath` attribute.


## [0.3.0] - 2017-03-03 - Packaging and polishing

### Added
* Add `callback_success` argument to `pyextract.extract`, which allows any function to be executed after an extraction (for GUI alerts / manipulation).
* Add `callback_error` argument to `pyextract.extract`, which will allow a function to execute when an error occurs, passing it that error.
* When extraction completes from the GUI, the 'Cancel' button will now change its label to 'Finish'.
* Add early validation and alert box for ECF selection in the GUI.
* Add early validation to the ECF parser functions so an error occurs if the ECF file contains a non-unique `NameAlias` for any query.
* Add `row_limit` to `SAPStream` class to improve unit test speed.
* Add `connection.setbusytimeout(50)` to SQLite connections, to ensure support for multiprocessing and multithreading.
* Added `*args` and `**kwargs` to MSSQL and Oracle connection functions to support the C2 method of instantiation with extra information.
* Made GUI resizeable during Wizard pages.

### Changed
* Renamed all test ECF files for consistency and clarity.
* Refactored ECF parsing to be consistant regardless of source.
* Refactored Metadata for consistancy and updates metadata to align with GATT loader requirements.
* Refactored SAP messenger and stream to be more modular and consistant with other DB stream/messenger functionality.
* Improved formatting of times and record counts in `SAPStream` log messages.
* Change name of `utils.clean_str_for_logging` to `utils.cleanstr` now that it is used more frequently.
* Now calling `pyextract.extract` from GUI using keyword arguments instead of positional ones for clarity.
* Now validating advanced options in the GUI earlier (on submitting the Advanced Options page).
* Combined `sap_to_sqlite_nested` and `sap_from_ecf_v1_6` unit tests into `TestExtractionFromSAP.test_sap_nested_from_ecf`.
* DB2 setup in the GUI will now default username to the logged in user.
* GUI now creates a ZIP package of files instead of placing them all on the desktop.
* Can now set a `output_folder` and `package_name` in the `pyextract.extract` function and in the GUI.

### Fixed
* Fixed the 'Confirmation Page' in the GUI to properly show selected values.
* Null values are no longer written to SQLite as the string 'None'
* SAP metadata is now written to master database during extraction.
* Clean all queries (replace tabs and newlines with spaces) before logging.
* If a `NameAlias` is provided for a query in an ECF, the output table will use that value for its name instead of the `Name` value.
* Make all SAP fields uppercase in `ECFParser.format_table_info` so that data is aligned with what is returned from SAP RFC function calls.
* Enclosed table and column names in SQLite with "double quotes" to allow more strings as identifiers.
* Fixed SAP `sapstream.get_header_split_docs` to work with schema-based databases (e.g. MSSQL).
* Updated MSSQL source-type mapping to return the best approximation of the source type in SQL Server syntax from the `ceODBC.Cursor.description` value.
* Fixed issue where GUI would display blank screen behind primary screen after selecting 'Another Extraction'.

### Removed
* Removed all unit tests and compatibility for v1.5 ECFs.
* Removed `total_rows_for_table` record count from `RfcTableExtractions` until it can be implemented reliably with multiprocessing.
* Removed setting of database `PRAGMA`s in SQLite (until we test performance).
* Simplified SAP extraction API so an `extraction_meta` namedtuple argument is no longer required to run `pyextract.extract`.


## [0.2.1] - 2017-02-16 - Standalone fixes and IBM DB2 support

### Added
* Added DB2 to the GUI as a source connection.
* Added unit test for DB2 to SQLite extraction.

### Fixed
* Removed hard coded SAP credentials from GUI to properly accept user input.
* Included DB2, GnuPG, Oracle, and SAP dependencies in `./build.spec` so the standalone program correctly runs on a no-dependency server (`US1HAL5W70048`)
* Fixed `pyextract.extract` to not create a duplicate `DataStream` when running SAP extractions (removes the 'Fatal Error' on SAP extraction start).
* Make 'Fatal Error' on extraction end auto-close with custom `forking.Popen` (https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/wiki/Recipe-Multiprocessing)
* Replaced Oracle `instantclient_12_1` with `instantclient_11_2`, which works with both our `R12` and `11i` testing databases.


## [0.2.0] - 2017-02-08 - Wizard-style GUI, ClickOnce, SAP Nesting, and MemSQL

### Added
* GUI deployment now uses ClickOnce (http://matlkecapapp001:7770/publish.htm) so future updates to the executable will be automatically downloaded. See the 'Deploying' section of `./README.md` for more information.
* Extraction from and to MemSQL and MySQL is now supported.
* Extraction from SAP using N-level Nesting (e.g. BKPF/BSEG) is now supported.
* Extraction using a SQL query or an ECF file is now supported in the GUI.
* Extraction from Oracle using `service_name` or `tnsname` in the GUI (in addition to current `service_id` option) is now supported.
* Unit test for extracting from ECF files.
* Unit test for writing to non-chunked SQLite database.
* Unit test for writing to a specifically-named output table.
* Trial versions of IBM-DB2 and CSV messengers have been created, but are not fully tested or integrated into the user interfaces.

### Changed
* Turned standalone GUI into a wizard-based interface.
* Set default Oracle `NLS_DATE_FORMAT` to `DD-Mon-YY` to support GATT v1.6 ECFs.
* Made `Extraction` class require a `DataStream` object as the `source` instead of an `ABCMessenger` object. This will allow the program to use more complex sources (SAP N-nesting) instead of only SQL-based ones.
* Turned class-level properties (e.g. `DataReader.CHUNK_SIZE`) into instance-level properties to support parallel runs with different settings.
* Changed `row_limit` option of `SQLStream` to work on a per-table / per-extract basis instead of for the life of the object.
* Environment variable `PYEXTRACT_PASSWORD` must now be set in order to run unit tests (available from PyExtract developers).
* Replaced `secret.py` with `credentials.dat`, an encrypted SQLite database.
* Made `test_core.py` unit tests more robust: now checking for table existence and accurate row counts in the SQLite versions of tests.
* Updated logging messages to be more consistent and have appropriate levels.

### Fixed
* Moved `multiprocessing.freeze_support()` to the top-level `gui.py` file, which solves the issue where workers would occasionally not write to SQLite.
* Overloaded `multiprocessing.forking._Popen` class with custom version that makes Processes / Threads safe for freezing into a standalone EXE.
* Explicitly included GPG binary (`iconv.dll`) in the standalone EXE.
* Explicitly included Oracle binary (`oraociei12.dll`) in the standalone EXE.
* General Pylint, Typing, and PEP-0008 updates on all files.

### Removed
* Removed `_assets` from Git repo and history, moving them to a [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B2RrjZ1HLSnjeXN1VlprbVpMdVk?usp=sharing)


## [0.1.0] - 2016-12-15 - Alpha

Initial version of Python Extract program.

### Features
* Extraction from MSSQL, Oracle, SQLite, and SAP single tables into MSSQL or SQLite, using standard SQL queries.
* Standalone executable graphic interface to run the program
* (Draft) Command-line interface for running Oracle to MSSQL extractions
